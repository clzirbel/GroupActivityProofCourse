\activitytitle{Pigeonhole Principle}{It was stated by Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1834 and it is sometimes called Dirichlet's Box Principle.}

\overview{The principle simply states that if we have more pigeons than holes then at least one hole must contain more than one pigeon. The next problem asks you to prove this principle.}

\problem{If $N$ pigeons are placed in $n$ pidgeonholes and $N>n$, then one of the pidgeonholes must contain two or more pigeons. 
{\bf Hint:} Prove by contradiction.}{.8in}

\problem{A bag contains M\&M's in six different colors: Brown, Yellow, Green, Red, Orange and Blue. How many M\&M's do you need to take out of the bag in order to have at least two of the same color? How many do you need to take out of the bag if you want to have three of the same color?}{1in}

\problem{Suppose we need to place $N$ items into $n$ boxes and $N>n$. Then at least one box must contain at least $\lceil \frac{N}{n} \rceil$ items. 
{\bf Hint:} Let $N_i$ be the number of items in box $i$, where $1\leq i \leq n$. Then $N=N_1+N_2+ \ldots + N_n$. Suppose by the way of contradiction that $N_i<\lceil \frac{N}{n} \rceil$, for all $i\in \{1, 2, \ldots,n \}$. Prove the fact that $\lceil \frac{N}{n} \rceil< \frac{N}{n} +1$ and use it to reach a contradiction.}{2in}

\problem{The human head contains less than $150,000$ hairs. Show that there are at least $500$ people with the same number of hairs in New York City. Assume that New York City has a population greater than $8,000,000$ people.}{1in}

\problem{Prove that no matter how we choose $51$ natural numbers from $\{1,2,3,\ldots,100\}$, at least two of them must be consecutive.
{\bf Hint:} Consider the pigeonholes to be the following sets: $\{1,2\}, \{3,4\}, \ldots , \{99,100\}$.}{2in}

\problem{Prove that given any ten natural numbers we can choose two of them such that their difference is divisible by nine.
{\bf Hint:} Consider the remainders when dividing by nine.}{1.5in}

\problem{Prove that if six integers are selected at random from the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ then at least two of them add up to eleven.}{1in}
