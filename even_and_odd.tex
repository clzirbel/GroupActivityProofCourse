\activitytitle{Even and odd}{Our first example of definitions, examples, theorems, and proofs}

\overview{Definitions are important to read and understand by looking at examples.  Many proofs are little more than working with the definitions and rewriting things.  With a bit of practice, these become very routine.  This activity has you work through two definitions, a few examples, and then some proofs.  Everything relies on the definitions, so keep coming back to them.  We will use a similar model many times during the semester.}

\definition{Even\label{evendef}}{An integer $n$ is {\em even} if there exists an integer $k$ for which $n = 2k$.}

\definition{Odd\label{odddef}}{An integer $n$ is {\em odd} if there exists an integer $k$ for which $n = 2k+1$.}

\example{Check that 12 meets the definition to be even.  Find the value of $k$ and write $12 = 2k$.}{0.4in}

\example{Does $-9$ meet the definition to be odd?  Find the value of $k$ and write $-9 = 2k+1$.}{0.4in}

\example{Does 0 meet the definition to be even?  Find the value of $k$.}{0.4in}

\example{Does 1.73 meet the definition to be odd?  Explain.}{0.4in}

\note{Suppose that $m$ is an integer.  Then $2m+1$ is an integer and it is odd because it meets the definition to be odd.  Also, $2m+2$ is even because it is an integer and can be rewritten as $2(m+1)$, which is of the form $2k$ where $k=m+1$, which is an integer.}

\show{Suppose that $m$ is an integer.  Show that $2m+6$ is even by rewriting it until it meets the definition to be even.}{0.5in}

\show{Suppose that $m$ is an integer.  Show that $4m + 9$ is odd by rewriting it until it meets the definition to be odd.}{0.5in}

\stop{Compare your answers to the questions above with the other people in your group before you move on.  Resolve any differences in your answers.}

\show{Suppose that $m$ is even.  Then $m = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
Show that $m+8$ is even by rewriting it as 2 times an integer.}{1in}

\note{You know perfectly well that the sum of two even numbers is even.  The next item guides you through a proof of this fact, using the definitions of even and odd above.}

\guidedproof{Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are even.  Fill in the blanks to show that $m+n$ is even.\label{sumofevens}
\blist{0.1in}
\item There exist integers $j$ and $k$ such that \blank{0.75in} and \blank{0.75in}.
\item Thus, $m + n = $ \blank{0.75in}.
\item This number is even because \blank{3.5in}.
\item We saw that if $m$ and $n$ are even, then $m+n$ is even.  
We made no further assumption about $m$ and $n$.
Thus, the sum of any two even numbers is even.

\guidedproof{Suppose that $m$ is even and $n$ is odd.
Fill in the blanks to show that $mn$ is even.  
Use the previous exercise as a model.
\blist{0.1in}
\item There exist \blank{2in} such that $m = $\blank{0.75in} and $n = $\blank{0.75in}.
\item Thus, $mn = $\blank{4in}.
\item This number is even because \blank{2in}.
\item We saw that \blank{4in}.  We made no \\\blank{3in}.
Thus, \blank{2.5in}.

\prove{Let $m$ and $n$ be odd.  Follow the examples above as a model to show that $mn$ is odd by rewriting $mn$ until it meets the definition to be odd.  Good form is critically important in proofs.

\groupwork{Steps 1 and 3 in your proofs connect to the definitions of even and odd.  Write a sentence telling what happens in step 1 and in step 3.
Make sure that every member of your group has gotten to this step.
Compare your sentence to those written by the other people in your group, then work together to write the best version of the sentence that your group can.}{2in}

\prove{Let $m$ be even.  Follow the models above to prove that $m^2$ is even.  Use good form.}{1.5in}

\question{What does it mean that an integer is a multiple of 4?  Give your own definition analogous to the definitions of even and odd.}{0.5in}

\prove{Let $m$ be even.  Show that $m^2 +2m + 4$ is a multiple of 4.}{1in}

\question{Let $m$ be even.  Can $m^2 +2m + 4$ be a multiple of 8?  Explain.}{1in}

\noindent
{\bf Challenges.}  Here are some statements that are harder to prove, because they require a bit more than simply restating the definitions.
See if you can make a good argument for them.

\prove{If $m$ is an integer, then either $m$ is even or $m$ is odd. \Hint:  0 is even.  If $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd.  If $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even.  This tells us something about all positive integers.  If $n$ is even, then $-n$ is even.}{1.5in}



\prove{If $m$ is an integer and $m^2$ is odd, then $m$ is odd.
\Hint:  There are two cases to check, the case in which $m$ is even and the case in which $m$ is odd.}{1.5in}
