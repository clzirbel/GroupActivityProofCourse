\definitionNN{Positive real numbers}{By construction, the real numbers have a subset $\Rp$, called the {\em positive real numbers,} for which:
\balist{0.3in}
\item If $a,b \in \Rp$, then $a + b \in \Rp$.  ($\Rp$ is closed under addition.)
\item If $a,b \in \Rp$, then $a\cdot b \in \Rp$.  ($\Rp$ is closed under multiplication.)
\item For every real number $a$, either $a \in \Rp$ or $(-a) \in \Rp$ or $a = 0$.  Exactly one of the three happens.
