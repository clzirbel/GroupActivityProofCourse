\activitytitle{Quiz on nested quantifiers and negation of quantifiers}{40 points}

\blist{0in}
\item Show that for all real numbers $a > 0$, there exists an integer $n$ such that for all $m > n$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} < a$.
Since there are three quantifiers, you will use the word ``let'' three times.
Be clear what is happening each time!

\item Rewrite the statement in Problem 1 using quantifiers.

Now, negate the statement and push the ``not'' past all of the quantifiers.

\item On the back of the page, show that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ with $0 < x < y$, we have $x^2 < y^2$.
It's not enough to say that the result is obvious or just look at examples, you need to find a way to break this into smaller steps that you can verify.
Make note of each time you use one of the assumptions in the proof.

\noindent
Extra credit for writing two distinct proofs.
For example, for a second proof, you could use integrals.
