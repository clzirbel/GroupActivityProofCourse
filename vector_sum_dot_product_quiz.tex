\activitytitle{Quiz on sum and dot product of 3--dimensional vectors}{10 points}

\definitionNN{3--dimensional vector}{A three--dimensional vector is an ordered triple $\vect{ a_1, a_2, a_3 }$, where $a_1, a_2,$ and $a_3$ are real numbers.}

\definitionNN{Equality of 3--dimensional vectors}{3--dimensional vectors $\vect{ a_1, a_2, a_3 }$ and $\vect{ b_1, b_2, b_3 }$ are equal if $a_1=b_1, a_2=b_2,$ and $a_3 = b_3$.  The order of the numbers is important.}

\definitionNN{Sum of 3--dimensional vectors}{The sum of 3--dimensional vectors $\vect{ a_1, a_2, a_3 }$ and $\vect{ b_1, b_2, b_3 }$ is the 3--dimensional vector $\vect{ a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, a_3+b_3 }$.  We write $\vec{a} \oplus \vec{b}$, using a new symbol so we don't confuse addition of vectors with addition of real numbers.}

\showNN{Show that addition of 3--dimensional vectors is commutative.
Start with ``Let,'' take one step at a time, write the justification for the step, and make a general conclusion.

\definitionNN{Dot product of 3--dimensional vectors}{The dot product of 3--dimensional vectors $\vect{ a_1, a_2, a_3 }$ and $\vect{ b_1, b_2, b_3 }$ is the real number $a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3$.}

\showNN{On the other side of this sheet of paper, show that the dot product is distributive over vector addition.
That is, show that $(\vec{a} \oplus \vec{b}) \bullet \vec{c} = \vec{a} \bullet \vec{c} + \vec{b} \bullet \vec{c}.$  Start with ``Let \ldots,'' take one step at a time, write the justification for the step, and make a general conclusion.  Please also explain why one addition symbol is $\oplus$ and the other is $+$.}{0in}
