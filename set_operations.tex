\activitytitle{Operations on sets}{This activity works with set identities and relates them to logic.}

\overview{Sets are absolutely fundamental to mathematics.
This chapter focuses on building up set identities, relationships between sets that are always true.}

\problem{Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  Show that $(A \cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c}$ by showing set inclusion both ways.  This is one of de Morgan's laws.  Draw a really nice Venn diagram to illustrate.}{2in}

\problem{Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  Show that $(A \cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \cup B^{c}$ by showing set inclusion both ways.  This is the other one of de Morgan's laws.  Draw a really nice Venn diagram to illustrate.}{2in}

\problem{\label{setsaslogic}Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  Let $P$ be the logical statement $x \in A$, and let $Q$ be the logical statement $x \in B$.
Use $P$ and $Q$ and logic symbols to fill in the simplest expressions:
\blist{0.1in}
\item $x \in A \cup B$ is \blank{1in}
\item $x \in (A \cup B)^{c}$ is $\lnot (P \wedge Q)$
\item $x \in A^c$ is \blank{1in}
\item $x \in B^c$ is \blank{1in}
\item $x \in A^c \cap B^c$ is \blank{1in}
\elist
Make a truth table for $P$, $Q$, and each of the other logical statements here to establish that $x \in (A \cup B)^c$ is logically equivalent to $x \in A^c \cap B^c$.
Compare the truth values in the columns corresponding to $x \in (A \cup B)^c$ to the Venn diagram you made above.  Explain how they agree.

\problem{Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  Use the approach of the previous exercise to show that $x \in (A \cap B)^{c}$ is logically equivalent to $x \in A^{c} \cup B^{c}$.  Compare the truth table to the Venn diagram again.}{2in}

\problem{Let $D, E,$ and $F$ be sets.
Use one of de Morgan's laws that you showed above to establish that $(D \cup E \cup F)^c = D^c \cap E^c \cap F^c$.
This proof works by rewriting, not by showing inclusion both ways.
{\bf Hint:} Let $A = D \cup E$ and $B = F$.}{1.5in}

\problem{Let $D, E,$ and $F$ be sets.
Use one of de Morgan's laws to show that $(D \cap E \cap F)^c = D^c \cup E^c \cup F^c$.}{1.5in}

\problem{Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be sets.
Use a proof by cases to show that $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$.  Remember to show inclusion both ways.
Organize your writing carefully to make the steps of this argument really clear.}{3in}

\problem{Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be sets.
Use logical statements $P, Q,$ and $R$ and a truth table to show that $x \in A \cup (B \cap C)$ is logically equivalent to $x \in (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$.  Be sure to define $P$, $Q$, and $R$ at the beginning.}{2.5in}

\definition{Symmetric difference}{Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  The {\em symmetric difference} of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \bigtriangleup B = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A)$.}

\problem{Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.  Show that $A \bigtriangleup B = B \bigtriangleup A$ by showing set inclusion both ways.  Draw a nice Venn diagram to illustrate.}{2in}

\problem{Consider again the logical statements from \ref{setsaslogic}.  Write a logical statement that is equivalent to $x \in A \bigtriangleup B$.
Make a truth table with 4 rows, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and three columns, one for $x \in A$, one for $x \in B$, and the third for $x \in A \bigtriangleup B$.
Draw a Venn diagram and label the regions in it 1, 2, 3, 4 so that they correspond to the truth table.}{1in}

\problem{Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be sets.  Show that $(A \bigtriangleup B) \bigtriangleup C = A \bigtriangleup (B \bigtriangleup C)$ in these ways.
\blist{0.1in}
\item Draw separate Venn diagrams for the two sets.
\item Show set inclusion both ways.
\item Convert inclusion in $A \bigtriangleup B$, $B \bigtriangleup C$, and other sets to logical statements and use a truth table to show the equality.
