\item Let $n$ and $k$ be integers and suppose that $k > 0$.
Suppose that there exist integers $q$ and $r$ for which $n = qk + r$ and $0 \leq r < k$, and at the same time that there exist integers $q_2$ and $r_2$ for which $n = q_2 k + r_2$ and $0 \leq r_2 < k$.
Show that $q = q_2$ and $r = r_2$.
Bonus points for doing this without dividing by $k$.
This shows that there is at most one way to write $n$ as $qk + r$ with $0 \leq r < k$.

\item Write your solution to this problem on the back of the page.
Let $n$ be an integer and suppose that $n^2$ is a multiple of 3.
Use the Division Algorithm to write $n$ as $3m$, $3m+1$, or $3m+2$, and then use the Division Algorithm to rule out the last two cases.
Make clear which part of the Division Algorithm you use in each part.
