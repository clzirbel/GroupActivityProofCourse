\activitytitle{Infinite unions and intersections}{}

\overview{We are working with infinitely many sets of real numbers.  These exercises will give you practice with sets and teach you things about the real numbers as well.}

\definition{Union}{Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be sets.
The {\em union} of $A_1, A_2, \ldots$, which is denoted $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, is all elements which are in $A_n$ for some $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots.$}

\definition{Intersection}{Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be sets.
The {\em intersection} of $A_1, A_2, \ldots$, which is denoted $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, is all elements which are in $A_n$ for all $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots.$}

\problem{Use quantifiers to express what it means that $x \in \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n.$\\
{\bf Solution:} $\exists n$ such that $x \in A_n$.
In words, there is at least one $n$ for which $x$ is in $A_n$; that is what it takes to be in the union.}{0.0in}

\problem{Use quantifiers to express what it means that $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n.$}{0.2in}

\exercise{To show $A \subseteq \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n:$  Let $x \in A$, and show that $x \in B_n$ for all $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
What kind of proof do you need to write in order to show that $x \in B_n$ for all $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$?
What is the first line of that part of the proof?}{0.1in}

\exercise{To show $A \subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n:$  Let $x \in A$, and show that $x \in B_n$ for some $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
In other words, show that $\exists n$ such that $x \in B_n$.
What kind of proof do you need to write in order to show that $x \in B_n$ for some $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$?
What is going to have to happen first in the proof?}{0.1in}

\remark{To show $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \subseteq B:$  Let $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$.
Then you know that $x \in A_n$ for all $n$, which is a lot of information about $x$.
Use this information to show that $x \in B$.
Exactly how that will work depends on the problem.
}

\remark{To show $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \subseteq B:$  Let $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$.
Then you know that $x \in A_n$ for some $n$, but you don't know which $n$, so that is not very informative.
There are infinitely many cases, one for each possible value of $n$.
The best you can do is to start with, ``Suppose $x \in A_n$'' and work forward from there to show that $x \in B$.
In the end, this is the same as showing that $A_n \subseteq B$ for all $n$.

\problem{Let $\displaystyle A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} [n,n+1)$.  

\balist{0.2in}
\item Write $A$ in open form, listing out the first five sets in the union:

$A = \blank{0.75in} \cup \blank{0.75in} \cup \blank{0.75in} \cup  \blank{0.75in} \cup \blank{0.75in} \cup \cdots$

\item Figure out what interval $A$ is equal to and call the new interval $B$.  $B$ = \blank{1in}.

\item Show that $A \subseteq B$.

\noindent
Let $x \in A$.
Then $x \in [n,n+1)$ for \blank{1.5in}.

\vspace{0.8in}
\noindent
Thus, $x \in B$.  Since $x \in A$ was arbitrary, $A \subseteq B$.

\item Show that $B \subseteq A$.

\noindent
Let $x \in B$.  
You need to show that there exists an $n$ for which $x \in [n,n+1)$.  
You need to construct the value of $n$, starting with $x$.

\vspace{0.8in}
\noindent
Thus, $x \in [n,n+1)$, and so $x \in A$.  Since $x \in B$ was arbitrary, $B \subseteq A$.

\item List out the first five sets in this union, as you did above.
Draw them on a number line if it helps.

\item Make a conjecture about how you can write $A$ in a simpler way and call the new set $B$.
It should be the union of three simpler things.

\item Show that $A \subseteq B$.
Let $x \in A$.  Then $x \in [n,n^2]$ for some $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots.$.
You want to show that $x \in B$.
You can do this with three cases, depending on whether $n=0$, $n=1$, or $n > 1$.
Each case needs to end with $x \in B$.

\vspace*{1in}

\item Show that $B \subseteq A$.
Let $x \in B$.
There are three cases, and in each one, you will need to construct $n$ so that $x \in [n, n^2]$.
Each case needs to end with $x \in A$.

You will need to use this property of real numbers:  if $x > 0$, then there exists a positive integer $n$ with $0 < \frac{1}{n} < x$.}{3in}

Start by writing a logical expression that means the same thing as $x \in \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right)^c$ and work with it until it is a logical expression for $x \in \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} A_n^c$.
When you write the proof this way, you do not need to show containment both ways to show that the two sets are equal.

$x \in \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right)^c$ means $\lnot (\exists $integer $n$ such that $x \in A_n)$, which means \ldots
