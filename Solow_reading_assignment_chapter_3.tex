\activitytitle{Reading assignment \#3}{Due on Tuesday, September 19.  20 points}

Read Chapter 3 in the book by Daniel Solow.
This chapter is about definitions and how to use them in the forward and backward process.
\noindent
{\bf Specific requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item When reading Section 3.1, pay close attention to ``if and only if'' because it comes up often in proofs, and you need to know how to show an ``if and only if'' statement.

\item In Section 3.1, there is a page and a half on overlapping notation.
We had an example of this when imagining an integer that is both even and odd.
Some people wrote $n=2k$ and $n=2k+1$.
What would be better to write and why?

\item In Section 3.2, force yourself to work through the proof of Proposition 3 in your notes, using Proposition 1.
Rewrite the argument in your own words.
If you can do that without reading the proof in the book, so much the better.

\item In Section 3.3, make yourself a glossary (vocabulary list) for the terms in bold font so you learn them well.
You can skip the truth tables for now.

\item Do Exercise 3.2.  You do not need to write proofs, only pose the key question, answer it abstractly, and rephrase your answer in terms used in the problem.

\item Do Exercise 3.5 parts c and d.
This will be a bit challenging because it requires you to look up two new definitions and interpret them.
That's an excellent skill, so practice it.

\item Do Exercise 3.12.

\item Do Exercise 3.15.

\item Do Exercise 3.19.

\item Do Exercise 3.21.

\item Do Exercise 3.27.


\item At the end, tally up how much time you have spent on this chapter.
Write this number in your notebook and remember the number when you come to class.
Bring your notebook to class and turn it in for grading.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf General comments}

Set yourself up in a place where you won't be disturbed.
Read slowly, and write notes in your own words that reflect your understanding of the material.
Fortunately, this does not seem to be a complicated chapter, so just work through it and make sure you get the message.
