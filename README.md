GroupActivityProofCourse
========================

A sequence of activities for students to work on in groups to learn how to write mathematical proofs at the undergraduate level.

These materials may be used for an undergraduate mathematics course whose goal is to help students learn the fundamental mathematical process of looking at examples, making a definition, checking more examples, making conjectures, looking for counterxamples and refining conjectures, and then writing proofs.

The Git repository contains all LaTeX source code necessary for producing the materials for the course.
This makes it easy to re-order material, add your own activities, etc.

The activities are designed so that they can be handed out to a group of students who work on them individually and as a group while the instructor circulates among them answering questions and checking progress.  The activities are intended to be self contained and to require no introduction in a lecture.  The inspiration for these activities is the POGIL project, but the materials here have not been evaluated by that project.

Corrections, suggestions, and additions are welcome.

From time to time, the whole course is compiled with LaTeX and is then available in the file proofcourse.pdf.
