\noindent
Please use one side of a sheet of paper for each problem.
If you are totally stuck, you can ask for a hint, but it may cost you a little something.
Good luck!

\item Show that $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ for all $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
In other words, show that $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.
Use good form.
{\bf Hint:} Factor out $(n+1)$, don't multiply it out.

\item Answer this question on the back of the paper.

Use mathematical induction to show that $7^n - 1$ is divisible by 6 for all $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$.
Use good form.

\item Suppose that $A \subset B$.  Show that $A \cap B \subset B$.
You can draw a Venn diagram, but write a regular proof considering an arbitrary value of $x$.
{\bf Hint:} Show inclusion and also show that the sets are not equal.

Suppose that $A \cap B \subset B$.  Does this imply that $A \subset B$?  If so, show it.  If not, draw a Venn diagram that shows what else could happen.

\item Answer this question on the back of the paper.

Show that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{n},2) = (0,2)$.

\item Show that $[3,7] \cup (5,9) = [3,9)$ by showing set inclusion both ways.

\item Answer this question on the back of the paper.

Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are integers and that $3m = 7n$.
Show that $n$ is a multiple of 3.
Do this by writing $n$ as $3q+r$ for different possible values of $r$ and figuring out which values of $r$ make sense.
