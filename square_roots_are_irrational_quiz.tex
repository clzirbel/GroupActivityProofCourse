\activitytitle{Quiz on irrationality of square roots of odd primes}{20 points}

\showNN{Show that if $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is a multiple of 47, then $n$ is a multiple of 47.  You choose the type of proof you want to do.  Whatever you do, there are too many cases to check one by one, so organize your thoughts efficiently.}{7in}

\showNN{On the other side of this sheet of paper, show that $\sqrt{47}$ is irrational.  I recommend a proof by contradiction.}{0in}
