\item You have been asked to read the textbook, and we have checked your notes to make sure this is happening.
Would you recommend that other faculty do the same in their courses?
{\bf yes \quad no}
\\
Please explain.

Would you recommend that other students read their textbooks the same way in other courses?
{\bf yes \quad no}
\\
Please explain.


\item To what extent do you minimize distractions when you are reading the textbook?  Do you turn off your cell phone?  Do you study alone?  I'm curious how hard you try to minimize distractions which will break your chain of thought, and whether it helps you understand the book more.

\item In what way(s) have you changed how you work with the textbook in other courses that you are taking?  Do you read them more?  Differently?

\item In class, we work through activities without much ``lecture.''
How does this work for you?

\item Is there anything we should change about the class?

\item What is going well in the class, so that we should not change it?

\item Is this class making good progress on making you unstoppable in your other math courses?

\item What else could we do to make you unstoppable in your other math courses?

\item Do you look forward to coming to class?  Why or why not?
