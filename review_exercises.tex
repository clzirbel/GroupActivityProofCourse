\definition{Cross product}{Let $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ be 3--dimensional vectors.
The cross product of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is a new vector given by $\vect{a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2, a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3, a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1}$.
The cross product is denoted $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$.
}

\prove{Show that the cross product is distributive over vector addition, that is, that $\vec{a} \times (\vec{b} \oplus \vec{c}) = \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \oplus \vec{a} \times \vec{c}$.
Take small steps and justify each step.}{2.5in}

\prove{Show that the cross product is anti-symmetric:  for all 3--dimensional vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, we have $\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -\vec{b} \times \vec{a}$.}{1.5in}

\prove{Define $\ln x = \int_{1}^{x} \frac{1}{t} dt$ for all real numbers $x > 0$.  
Show that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ with $0 < x < y$, we have $\ln x < \ln y$.
Working backward, rewrite $\ln x$ and $\ln y$ in terms of integrals, and then write an equality that relates integrals over different intervals.}{2in}

\prove{Let $n$ be an integer and suppose that $n^2$ is a multiple of 7.
Show that $n$ is a multiple of 7.
Use the Division Algorithm to do this by cases, and be crystal clear about the structure of the proof.}{2in}

\prove{Show that $\sqrt{7}$ is irrational.}{1.5in}

\prove{For each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots,$ let $a_n = \frac{n^2 + 3}{n^2 + 1}$.  Show that for all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $n$ with $a_n - 1 < \varepsilon$.
Be careful to recognize the two quantifiers in the statement and use appropriate proof techniques for each one.
\Hint Rewrite $a_n$ to look like 1 plus something small.
