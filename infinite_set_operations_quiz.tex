\item
Let $B = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} [n, n^2]$.
List out the first five or more sets in this union.
Draw them on a number line if it helps.

Let $C = \{0\} \cup \{1\} \cup [2,\infty)$.
Show that $B = C$ by showing containment in both directions.
You will need to use three cases in each direction to deal with $0, 1,$ and the rest.
