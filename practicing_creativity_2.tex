\overview{Many proofs require a spark of genius, an idea that might not come to you right away.  It's OK to try the first thing you think of, but when it does not seem to be working out, deliberately look for a large number of possible things to try, and then choose which one looks the most promising.}

\note{Give these problems a try on your own.  If you get stuck, deliberately stop and look for other ways to do the problem.  Then share these ideas with the people in your group.}

\groupwork{Let $n$ be an integer.  Show that $n^2 + 5n + 6$ is even.  There are a few different ways to do this problem.  Can you find one way to do it?  More than one?  Be patient and specifically look for different ways to look at it.}{4in}
