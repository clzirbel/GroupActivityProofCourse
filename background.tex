\item How comfortable are you already with the ``definition, example, theorem, proof'' progression in mathematics classes?

\item What kinds of experiences have you had in the past with proofs?

\item Have you ever had success reading a mathematics textbook and really learning from it?  If so, please tell what book, what course, and what made it work.  If not, please tell me what you think prevented you from being able to read the book.

\item How do you have Canvas configured, to send you emails or texts or what?  How does that work for you?

\item If you take the elevator to the fourth floor, do you turn right or left to get to my office?

\item What are the two flyers on my door about?

\item Do you have a hard copy of the textbook that you can read?  Have you been able to get a PDF file of the first chapter from the library?

\item Do you have any interest in going to graduate school?  Please explain.

\item Do you have any questions or concerns about the coursework?

\item Do you have any questions or concerns about the grading?

\item What is the most likely reason that you will miss class?  I'm just curious.

\item What mathematics courses have you already taken in college?

\item What mathematics courses are you taking this semester?
It's OK to just list the numbers, like Math 3410.

\item Including this one, how many semesters until you graduate?

\item Please let me know anything you think I should know about you.  I'll read it all.  Sometimes people like to tell about their hobbies, movies they like, other academic interests, clubs they're in, where they're from, etc.
