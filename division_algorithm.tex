\activitytitle{The Division Algorithm}{Dividing integers with remainders will form the basis for several things we want to prove.}

\overview{We would like to distribute $n$ objects evenly among $k$ people and find out how many are left over.  We will investigate a procedure for doing this, which is called division, even though there will be no fractions in this activity.  Procedures that are guaranteed to work are called {\em algorithms} after the 9th century Persion mathematician al-Khwarizmi, who worked on procedures for arithmetic.  The division algorithm itself dates to Euclid's {\em Elements} from around 300 BC.}

\example{\label{37among5} You are the dealer in a card game that has 37 cards.  (It's not a standard deck of cards.)  There are 5 people playing, and everyone needs to end up with the same number of cards.  Dealing one card to each player leaves 32 cards in your hands.  Write down the numbers 37, 32, and continue until you cannot deal out any more cards evenly:  

\vspace{0.2in}
\noindent
Let $r$ denote the number of cards left over at the end, and let $q$ denote the number of times you subtracted 5, which is also the number of cards that each person got.  Notice that $0 \leq 5q \leq 37$.
You see that $37 - 5q = r$, which you can rewrite as $37 = 5q + r$.  Fill in $q$ and $r$ and write out these two equations.

\noindent
$37-5q = r$ becomes:
\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent
$37 = 5q +r$ becomes:
}{0.2in}

\example{Now you're playing a card game that you have not played before, and you haven't taken the time to count how many cards are in the deck.  You are the dealer again, and there are 5 people who need cards.  Let $n$ denote the number of cards in the deck.  Imagine that you repeat the procedure from the previous example until you can no longer deal out cards evenly.  Again, let $r$ denote the number of cards you have left over at the end and let $q$ denote the number of cards that each person got.

\noindent
Write the relationship between $n$, 5, $q$, and $r$ analogous to $37 - 5q = r$ and the expression analogous to $37 = 5q + r$.  
\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent
The last expression accounts for where all of the $n$ cards have gone; some are dealt out, some are left in your hands.  Write out a sentence that explains this.}{0.3in}

\example{Continuing to divide by 5, complete this sentence:  Given an integer $n > 0$, there exist integers $q$ and $r$ where (list properties of $q$ here) \blank{2in} and (list properties of $r$ here) \blank{2in}, such that (write the relationship between $n$, $q$, and $r$ analogous to $37 = 5q + r$) \blank{2in}.}{0in}

\example{\label{positivepositivedivision} 
Once again, we have $n$ cards, but now there are $k$ people playing, where $k > 0$ is an integer.
You are dealing.
Describe in words how you will deal out the cards and when you will stop.

\vspace{0.4in}

Describe in words how many cards you will have left over.


\vspace{0.4in}
\noindent
Using $q$ to denote the number of cards each person gets and $r$ to denote the number of cards left over, write out the relationship between $n, k, q,$ and $r$, and write inequalities concerning $q$ and $r$.}{1in}

\stop Compare your work to the others in your group and reconcile any differences.

\question{What happens when $k=0$?  Can you satisfy $n = qk + r$?  What goes wrong?  Describe in words, and take your time to get it right, because this explains why we don't divide by 0.}{1in}

\note{As above, suppose that $n$ and $k$ are integers that are greater than 0.
Suppose you find integers $q$ and $r$ for which $n = qk + r$ and $0 \leq r < k$.
Suppose your friend tries to do the same thing and finds integers $q_2$ and $r_2$ for which $n = q_2 k + r_2$ and $0 \leq r_2 < k$.
Must it be the case that $q = q_2$ and $r = r_2$?
That is, are the values of $q$ and $r$ {\em unique}?
If you think about dealing $n$ cards to $k$ people, it's pretty clear that you and your friend will get the same values of $q$ and $r$, but how can we see this without thinking about card dealing?
It will take a few steps.
}

\show{\label{remainderinequality} Suppose that $r$ and $r_2$ are integers for which $0 \leq r < k$ and $0 \leq r_2 < k$.
Carefully combine these inequalities to show that $-k < r-r_2 < k$.
Your goal is to provide a crystal clear argument with no extra steps.
Note:  You can add inequalities that run the same direction; for example, if $a < b$ and $c < d$, then $a+c < b+d$.
}{2in}

\show{\label{DivisionAlgorithmUniqueness}Suppose that $n$ and $k$ are integers, that $n \geq 0$ and $k > 0$, that $q$, $r$, $q_2$, and $r_2$ are integers such that $n = qk + r$ and $n = q_2 k + r_2$, and that $0 \leq r < k$ and $0 \leq r_2 < k$.
Note that $qk + r$ is equal to $q_2 k + r_2$ and use \ref{remainderinequality} to argue that $q = q_2$ and $r = r_2$.
It will probably not be obvious how to get started; this proof requires a spark of genius.
Use scratch paper, write down everything you know, including \ref{remainderinequality}, and then write a final argument here.

\theorem{\label{divisionalgorithm}{\bf The Division Algorithm.} Let $n$ and $k$ be integers greater than 0.  Then,
\blist{0in}
\item {\bf Existence.} There exist integers $q$ and $r$ for which $n = qk + r$ and for which $0 \leq r < k$.
\item {\bf Uniqueness.}  The numbers $q$ and $r$ are unique; $n = qk + r$ is the only way to write $n$ as a multiple of $k$ plus a remainder from $0, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$.
\elist
The number $q$ is called the {\em quotient} and $r$ is called the {\em remainder}.
Note that there are two parts to the theorem.
You have proven this theorem above in two problems.
The existence part was proven in \blank{0.8in}.  The uniqueness part was proven in \blank{0.8in}.

\prove{Let $n$ be an integer greater than 0.
Recall the definitions of even and odd.
Use the existence part of the division algorithm with $k=2$ to show that $n$ must satisfy at least one of these definitions.}{0.7in}

\prove{Let $n$ be an integer greater than 0.
Use the uniqueness part of the division algorithm with $k=2$ to conclude that if $n$ is even, then it cannot be odd.  Also, if $n$ is odd, it cannot be even.  Thus, each integer is even or odd, never both.

\note{Now we will divide negative numbers by positive numbers, with remainder.}

\example{Start with $-37,$ add 5 to get $-32$, and add 5 repeatedly, writing down the numbers you come to, until you reach a number from 0 to 4.

\vspace{0.4in}
\noindent
Count the number of 5's that you added to write $-37 = 5q + r$; you fill in $q$ and $r$.
Note the sign of the quotient $q$.

\vspace{0.4in}
\noindent
This represents division of a negative number by 5, with remainder.
How does it differ from division of a positive number with remainder?

\show{Let $n$ be an integer and suppose that $n = 3m + 1$ for some integer $m$.
Use the Division Algorithm to argue that $n$ cannot be written as $n = 3k$ where $k$ is an integer.
Thus, $n$ is not a multiple of 3.

Once again, let $n$ be an integer and suppose that $n^2$ is a multiple of 3.
Use your cases above to rule out the possibilities that $n = 3q+1$ or $n=3q+2$, and conclude that $n$ must be a multiple of 3.
This is harder than you might think to do clearly; work hard on it.
