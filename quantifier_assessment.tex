\noindent {\bf A.} Write the following statements symbolically:
\blist{0.4in}
\item For every $a$, there is a $b$ for which $b^2 = a$
\item For every $b$, there is an $a$ for which $b^2 = a$
\item For every $a$ and every $b$, it is the case that $b^2 = a$
\item There exists an $a$ and there exists a $b$ such that $b^2 = a$
\elist

\noindent {\bf B.} Which of the statements in the previous problem are true if the universe for both $a$ and $b$ is the set of non--negative integers?
If not true, explain why not.
